Java REST API with SpringBoot on gradle and with MariaDB Database built on Docker.

## Getting started
1. Start Docker-Compose to get the Database up and running :
   
   You can do it with your IDE or with `docker-compose up` command-line.
   
2. Start Gradle to build and compile your application (better done with the IDE).
3. Open any API-testing app like `Insomnia` or `Postman` and enjoy.
